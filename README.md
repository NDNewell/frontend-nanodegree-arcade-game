Cartman Crush (frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
===============================================


  What is it?
  -----------

  This is the third project for Udacity's front-end Nano degree. It is a frogger
  like game where the player, Eric Cartman, must navigate a street filled with
  killer bugs in order to reach the water on the opposite side.


  How to play
  -----------

  - Cartman must reach the water three times in order to pass each level.

  - The game is won after passing the 4th level.

  - If Cartman collides with any of the bugs, one life is lost.

  - With each level progression, the bugs become faster.

  - When all lives have been lost, the game is over; the game can be restarted
    by pressing the spacebar.

  - During game play, Cartman can collect different objects called relics.

  - There are gem, heart, star, and key relics.

  - For every gem Cartman gets, points are received. The amounts are: 100 points
    for a blue gem, 300 points for an orange gem, and 500 for a green gem.

  - For every 1000 points, an extra life is gained.

  - Collecting a key automatically results in passing the level.

  - Collecting a heart yields one extra life.

  - Collecting a star gives Cartman "star power", which makes him immune to
    the bugs for 10 seconds.
